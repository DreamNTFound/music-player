# music-player

🎵 A simple music player application with basic playback controls.

---

## About

This project is a music player built using React and Vite. It provides a minimal setup to get React working efficiently with Vite's fast refresh and ESLint rules.

---

## Features

- Play, pause, and skip tracks
- Built with React + Vite for fast development
- ESLint integrated for clean code

---

## Technical Details

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available for React support:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rollup-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rollup)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev and build performance. To add it, see the [React Compiler documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

---

## ESLint Configuration

For production apps, using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules is recommended. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
